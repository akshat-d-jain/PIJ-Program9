# PIJ-Program9
# Thread Creation and Methods Demo

## Overview
This Java program demonstrates thread creation and various methods associated with threads. It allows users to create threads, check if a thread is alive, get the priority of a thread, and set the priority of a thread.

## Program Structure
The program consists of the following components:
- **MyThread Class:** Extends the Thread class and implements the `run()` method to define thread behavior.
- **ThreadDemo Class:** Contains the main method where the user interacts with the program. It provides a menu-driven interface to create, manage, and interact with threads.
- **findThreadByName Method:** Helper method to find a thread by its name.

## Functionality
- **Create and start a thread:** Allows users to enter a name for the thread and start its execution.
- **Check if a thread is alive:** Enables users to enter the name of a thread and check if it's alive.
- **Get thread priority:** Users can input the name of a thread and retrieve its priority.
- **Set thread priority:** Allows users to set the priority of a thread by providing its name and the desired priority.
- **Exit:** Terminates the program.

## Instructions
1. Compile and run the `ThreadDemo` class.
2. Follow the menu prompts to perform various operations related to thread creation and management.
3. Enter the required input as prompted by the menu options.
4. Choose the 'Exit' option to terminate the program.

## Repository Structure
- `ThreadDemo.java`: Contains the main program code.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the program.

## Dependencies
- Java SE Development Kit (JDK): Required to compile and run the Java program.

## Note
Ensure that the JDK is installed on your system and configured properly before running the program.
